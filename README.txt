1. Have not included extra paragraph to show scrollrevealjs as you can see the header and the footer have been made by it. and it was not looking great so I included it in the comments.

2.I don't know if it was a Linux thing or not but until and unless I was giving them the whole location including my home directory the html code didn't run on my browser that may not be your case, so please manipulate the location directory as per your Operating System.
